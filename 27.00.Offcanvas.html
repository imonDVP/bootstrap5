<!-- Offcanvas is similar to modals (hidden by default and shown when activated), except that is often used as a sidebar navigation menu. -->
<!-- The .offcanvas class creates the offcanvas sidebar.
The .offcanvas-start class positions the offcanvas, and makes it 400px wide. See examples below for more positioning classes.
The .offcanvas-title class ensures proper margins and line-height.
Then, add your content inside the .offcanvas-body class.
To open the offcanvas sidebar, you must use a <button> or an <a> element that points to the id of the .offcanvas container (#demo in our example).
To open the offcanvas sidebar with an <a> element, you can point to #demo with the href attribute, instead of data-bs-target attribute. -->
<!-- Use the .offcanvas-start|end|top|bottom to position the offcanvas to the left, right, top or bottom -->
<!-- You can also control when you want to hide or show the offcanvas menu on different screen widths, with the .offcanvas-sm|md|lg|xl|xxl classes -->
<!-- Use the .text-bg-dark class to create a dark offcanvas menu.
Tip: We have also added the .btn-close-white class to .btn-close, to create a white close button that looks nice with the dark background -->
