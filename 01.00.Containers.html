<!-- Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap, which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites. -->
<!-- What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs -->
<!-- What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops. -->
<!-- Advantages of Bootstrap:
Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera). Note that if you need support for IE11 and down, you must use either BS4 or BS3. -->
<!-- If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). -->
<!-- Bootstrap 5 is mobile-first
Bootstrap 5 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework. -->
<!-- The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. -->
<!-- Bootstrap 5 also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:
1.The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
2.The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport -->
<!-- Fixed Container
Use the .container class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.
Note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:
        Extra small <576px  Small ≥576px  Medium ≥768px Large ≥992px  Extra Large ≥1200px  XXL ≥1400px
max-width	   100%	           540px	     720px	          960px	      1140px	        1320px -->
<!-- Open the example below and resize the browser window to see that the container width will change at different breakpoints.
The XXL breakpoint (≥1400px) is new in Bootstrap 5, while the largest breakpoint in Bootstrap 4 is Extra large (≥1200px). -->
<!-- Fluid Container
Use the .container-fluid class to create a full width container, that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%) -->
<!-- Container Padding
By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding" -->
<!-- Responsive Containers
You can also use the .container-sm|md|lg|xl classes to determine when the container should be responsive.
The max-width of the container will change on different screen sizes/viewports:
Class:Extra small <576px Small ≥576px Medium ≥768px Large ≥992px  Extra large ≥1200px  XXL ≥1400px
.container-sm	100%	    540px	       720px	    960px	        1140px	            1320px
.container-md	100%	    100%	       720px	    960px	        1140px	            1320px
.container-lg	100%	    100%	       100%	        960px	        1140px	            1320px
.container-xl	100%	    100%	       100%	        100%	        1140px	            1320px
.container-xxl	100%	    100%	       100%	         100%	         100%	            1320px -->
