<!-- Three Equal Columns
Use the .col class on a specified number of elements and Bootstrap will recognize how many elements there are (and create equal-width columns). In the example below, we use three col elements, which gets a width of 33.33% each:
col         col         col
-->
<!-- Three Equal Columns Using Numbers
You can also use numbers to control the column width. Just make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns):
col-4           col-4           col-4
-->
<!-- Three Unequal columns
To create unequal columns, you have to use numbers. The following example will create a 25%/50%/25% split:
col-3       col-6       col-3
-->
<!-- Setting One Column Width
However, it is enough to only set the width of one column, and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it. The following example will create a 25%/50%/25% split:
col     col-6       col
-->
<!-- Row Cols
You can also control how many columns that should appear next to each other (regardless of how many cols), with the .row-cols-* classes -->
<!-- Equal Height
If one of the column is taller than the other (due to text or CSS height), the rest will follow -->
<!-- Responsive Classes
The Bootstrap 5 grid system has five classes:
1) .col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)
2) .col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)
3) .col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)
4) .col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)
5) .col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)
6) .col-xxl- (xxl devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)
The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
Tip: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for sm and md, you only need to specify sm. -->
<!-- No Gutters
To change the gutters (extra space) between columns, use any of the .g-1|2|3|4|5 classes (.g-4 is default).
To remove the gutter completely, use .g-0 -->
