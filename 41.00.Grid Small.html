        <p>The following example will result in a 25%/75% split on small, medium, large, xlarge and xxlarge devices
            (<strong>576px and above</strong>). On extra small devices, it will stack (100% width).</p>

<!-- Small devices are defined as having a screen width from 576 pixels to 767 pixels. -->
<!-- For small devices we will use the .col-sm-* classes. -->
<!-- Note: Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns):
For a 33.3%/66.6% split, you would use .col-sm-4 and .col-sm-8 (and for a 50%/50% split, you would use .col-sm-6 and .col-sm-6) -->
<!-- Auto Layout Columns
In Bootstrap 5, there is an easy way to create equal width columns for all devices: just remove the number from .col-sm-* and only use the .col-sm class on a specified number of col elements. Bootstrap will recognize how many columns there are, and each column will get the same width.
If the screen size is less than 576px, the columns will stack horizontally -->
<!-- But on medium devices the design may be better as a 50%/50% split.
Medium devices are defined as having a screen width from 768 pixels to 991 pixels.
For medium devices we will use the .col-md-* classes. -->
<!-- Now Bootstrap is going to say "at the small size, look at classes with -sm- in them and use those. At the medium size, look at classes with -md- in them and use those".
The following example will result in a 25%/75% split on small devices and a 50%/50% split on medium (and large, xlarge and xxlarge) devices. On extra small devices, it will automatically stack (100%). -->
<!-- Note: Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns):
Using Only Medium
In the example below, we only specify the .col-md-6 class (without .col-sm-*). This means that medium, large, extra large and XXL devices will split 50%/50% - because the class scales up. However, for small and extra small devices, it will stack vertically (100% width) -->
