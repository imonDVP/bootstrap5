<!-- The Popover component is similar to tooltips; it is a pop-up box that appears when the user clicks on an element. The difference is that the popover can contain much more content. -->
<!-- To create a popover, add the data-bs-toggle="popover" attribute to an element.
Use the title attribute to specify the header text of the popover, and use the data-bs-content attribute to specify the text that should be displayed inside the popover's body. -->
<!-- Note: Popovers must be initialized with JavaScript to work. -->
<!-- By default, the popover will appear on the right side of the element.
Use the data-bs-placement attribute to set the position of the popover on top, bottom, left or the right side of the element. -->
<!-- Note: The placement attributes do not work as you expect if it is not enough room for them. For example: if you use the top placement at the top of a page (where it is no room for it), it will instead display the popover below the element or to the right (wherever it is room for it). -->
<!-- By default, the popover is closed when you click on the element again. However, you can use the data-bs-trigger="focus" attribute which will close the popover when clicking outside the element -->
<!-- Tip: If you want the popover to be displayed when you move the mouse pointer over the element, use the data-bs-trigger attribute with a value of "hover" -->
